# url-Tracker
** The save tab feature will work when used as an extension only ** 


This project is in itself meant to be a google chrome web browser extension. This allows you to track leads (website url) whether you copy-paste the link or simply by adding the entire current tab. Upon pressing the add button, you will be able to see all your leads in an unordered list. Whenever you save or delete your leads, they are added and deleted to and from your local storage.
